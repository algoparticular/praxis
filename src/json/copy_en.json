With her luminous calm, Belén urges us to find the answers to our inner self, using each card as a mirror to evaluate or validate our path.\n\nThus the Particles bring us those messages that our Being is needing in this moment, in this here and now.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
